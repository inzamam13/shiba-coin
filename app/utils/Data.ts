Each block in the blockchain contains a set of transactions that have been verified by a network of nodes. Once a block is added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered, which makes the ledger tamper-proof and resistant to fraud.\n One of the key features of blockchain technology is decentralization, which means that there is no central authority controlling the network. Instead, the network is maintained by a decentralized network of nodes that work together to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. This makes the blockchain transparent and resistant to censorship, as no single party can control or manipulate it.",

This is typically done by sending a portion of the tokens to a burn address,which is a wallet that cannot be accessed by anyone. By removing these tokens from circulation, the total supply of the token is reduced, which can help to increase its value over time.\n\nIn addition to token burns, some cryptocurrencies also implement supply changes, which can alter the total supply of the token in circulation. This can be done by either increasing or decreasing the total supply of the token, depending on the needs of the network.Supply changes can have a significant impact on the value of a cryptocurrency, as they can affect the overall supply and demand dynamics of the token. For example, if the supply of a token is reduced, this can create a scarcity effect that can drive up its value. On the other hand, if the supply is increased, this can dilute the value of the token and reduce its price.\n\nIn conclusion, this module has covered several advanced concepts related to Shiba Coin, including the Shiba Inu ecosystem and tokenomics, how Shiba Coin differs from other cryptocurrencies, staking and farming on Shiba Swap, ERC-20 tokens and NFTs, and token burns and supply changes. By understanding these concepts, investors can gain a deeper appreciation for the unique features and potential of Shiba Coin, and make more informed investment decisions.",
